#DIGITAL ASSIGNMENT 3 ( STRUCTURED AND OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING )
#Now the project I have made ( ABOUT PROGRAM)

In the project , which I have made , I have bascially made a program in which a user will input any number( positive number WHOLE NUMBER)
and in that the program will calculate the factorial of the given number and then the program will display the last non zero number of the factorial of the number.
for ex: if the user is giving an input of 7, then we know that the factorial of 7 will be 5040, so the program will display the last non zero digit of the factorial of the given number which is 4
note: we have to input only those number whose factorial can be found ( and those type of the number are called as WHOLE NUMBER)
note : other than WHOLE NUMBER , we cannot find the factorial of the numbers and in that case the program will show error
